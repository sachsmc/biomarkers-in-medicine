Evaluating Biomarkers in Medicine: Methods and Practice
==============

Abstract 
--------
In recent years we have seen an explosion in the amount of medical research devoted to developing and evaluating biomarkers. Biomarkers are used in medicine for a variety of purposes. They can be used to diagnose an underlying condition, to give a prognosis, that is, to predict the likely clinical outcome in the absence of treatment, to predict the likely response to a new therapy not yet administered, and as surrogate outcomes, to predict the likely clinical outcome of a patient after receiving therapy. Standard statistical approaches to evaluating complex biomarkers can obscure important clinical information and inhibit the accumulation of knowledge.  In this talk I review some modern statistical methods for the evaluation of biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis, therapy-selection, and surrogacy. These tools allow for robust and comprehensive evaluation of biomarkers, enabling researchers to understand their clinical impact and scientific value.
