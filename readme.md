Evaluating Biomarkers in Medicine: Methods and Practice
==============

Abstract 
--------
In recent years we have seen an explosion in the amount of medical research devoted to developing and evaluating biomarkers. Biomarkers can be used to diagnose an underlying condition, to give a prognosis, that is, to predict the likely clinical outcome in the absence of treatment, to predict the likely response to a new therapy not yet administered, and to predict the likely clinical outcome of a patient after receiving therapy. Standard statistical approaches to evaluating complex biomarkers can obscure important clinical information and inhibit the accumulation of knowledge.  In this talk I review some modern statistical methods for the evaluation of biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis, and prediction. These tools allow for robust and comprehensive evaluation of biomarkers, enabling researchers to understand their clinical impact and scientific value.
